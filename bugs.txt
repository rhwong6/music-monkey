•Need to specify reason for not playing music when user using command is not in a channel
•When music stopped when paused, only playerfinish event fires, when bot disconnected by admin, only disconnect event fires
 therefore need to go disabled button state when both events fire
•Queue organisation messes up when a title long enough to create a new line is added (can fix by setting max characters of title with .. at the end)
•Need to change pause/play icon to event based, tbh can make a lot of things events based
•Back command displays wrong song in GUI
•Command for stopping music does not edit a defer reply (half fixed with response but gui update can be fixed with event based gui update)
•When player moves onto next track, gui is not updated
