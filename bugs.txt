•Queue organisation messes up when a title long enough to create a new line is added (can fix by setting max characters of title with .. at the end)
•If user skips last track, does not display action
•Commands shouldnt run when no player is active
•History may be wrong in specific scenarios
•UpdateGui runs twice when user skips a last track as the playerFinish event runs (make it so that it checks if it is the last track and only run through playerFinish)
 NOTE this might also be fine, as the non event one updates thea action footer
 NOTE AGAIN problem currently is that the footer action is not updating because playerfinish event fires before the skip action event, not allowing the skip action event to run
•Potential issue with stopping bot halfway through queue being unable to play a song when bot starts again (or maybe something needs to be an await) can also fix by checking if gui
message variable is null
•Skipping last song does not show in action footer
•Stopping player and then using the queue add command will try to update old messagegui
•Add bot restart when crashing (or try catch with error message)

•Commands shouldnt run when no player is active (except music play or queue add, can be fixed in commands)
•Queue add shouldnt run when no link/song is present in options
